**To run counter_pygame:**

Make sure pygame is installed using pip...
run 'app.py'

**What the App does**

This small project features two things:
    *button functionality*
    *display*

The user can increment or decrement a counter by 
mouse clicking the respective buttons on
a pygame window.

**What I learned**
 - Creating buttons for a user interface via images
 - Giving buttons functionality
 - Displaying a changing value on pygame window for user to see
